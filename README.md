Keylogger for Bootcon project!
Keylogger using Python
Basic Keylogger can record keys, mic audio, take a screenshot, gather clipboard information and send email
Advanced keylogger encrypts these files and then covers our tracks
Huge, HUGE, HUGE shoutout and honestly credit to Grant Collins on YouTube and his Keylogger tutorial that helped me refine some of my own code and work out the issues I was having getting the mic function and email functions to work!
